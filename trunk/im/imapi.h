/**
 * @brief send message Connect to FbTerm
 * @param mode keyboard input mode
 *
 * FbTerm provides two kinds of keyboard input modes, IM server can choose a favorite one with parameter mode of
 * connect_fbterm().
 *
 * If mode equals zero, IM server will receive characters translated by kernel with current keymap in SendKey messages.
 * There are some disadvantages in this mode, for example, shortcuts composed with only modifiers are impossible.
 * ( shortcuts composed with modifiers and normal keys can create a map if they are not mapped in current kernel keymap,
 * maybe we need add new messages like RequestKeyMap and AckKeyMap used by IM server to ask FbTerm to do this work. )

 * If mode is non-zero, FbTerm sets keyboard mode to K_MEDIUMRAW after Active Message, IM server will receive raw keycode
 * from kernel and have full control for keyboard, except FbTerm's shortcuts, e.g. Ctrl + Space.
 * Under this mode, IM server should translate keycodes to keysyms according current kernel keymap, change keyboard led
 * state and translate keysyms to characters if it want to send user input back to FbTerm. Because some translation of
 * keysyms to characters are not fixed (e.g. cursor movement keysym K_LEFT can be 'ESC [ D' or 'ESC O D'), message TermMode
 * sent by FbTerm is used to help IM server do this translation.
 *
 * keycode.c/keycode.h provides some functions to translate keycode to keysym and keysym to characters.
